# 🏰 The Stronghold – Brutal C++ OOP Strategy Game

**The Stronghold** is an ultra-challenging, console-based multiplayer strategy game developed as a capstone project for C++ OOP students. Set in a medieval kingdom, the game requires players to make real-time decisions while managing war, politics, economy, corruption, diplomacy, natural disasters, and more.

This game isn’t just for fun — it's designed to **push students to their C++ limits** by enforcing strict Object-Oriented Programming principles and advanced coding techniques.

## 🎯 Objective

Survive and dominate as the ruler of a medieval stronghold. Compete or cooperate with other players while maintaining stability, responding to dynamic events, and making strategic decisions in real time.

## 💡 Key Features

- 👑 **Kingdom Management**: Handle war, diplomacy, economy, and internal corruption
- 🕹️ **Multiplayer Console Gameplay**: Play against or with fellow players via the terminal
- 🌪️ **Randomized Events**: Natural disasters and unexpected twists keep the game unpredictable
- ⏱️ **Time-based Decisions**: Uses `sleep()` to simulate real-time responses

## 🧠 Learning Focus

This game is designed to reinforce and test the following advanced C++ concepts:

- 🔁 Inheritance, Polymorphism & Templates  
- 🧠 Exception Handling & File I/O  
- 🎯 Pointers & Dynamic Memory Management  
- 🔄 Interdependent Systems  
- 🎲 Randomized Events  
- ⏳ Time-Based Functionality

## ⚠️ Difficulty Level

> **EXTREME** – This project is intentionally hard. Only students with a deep understanding of C++ and OOP principles will be able to build and maintain this game.
