# Stronghold-game-OOPs-project
The Stronghold game is an ultra-challenging, console-based multiplayer strategy game designed to push C++ OOP students to their absolute limits. Players manage a medieval kingdom, dealing with war, politics, economy, corruption, diplomacy, natural disasters, and real-time strategic decisions.  This version of Stronghold enforces brutal OOP constraints, requiring students to master pointers, inheritance, polymorphism, templates, exception handling, file handling, dynamic memory management, interdependent mechanics, randomized events, and time-based functions (sleep()). The game is intentionally designed to be extremely difficult, ensuring that only students with a deep understanding of C++ and OOP principles can successfully complete it.
